**Abstract:**\
We present a computational framework for simulating deformable surfaces with second-order triangular finite elements. Our method develops numerical schemes for discretizing stretching, shearing, and bending energies of deformable surfaces in a second-order finite-element setting. In particular, we introduce a novel discretization scheme for approximating mean curvatures on a curved triangle mesh. Our framework also integrates a virtual-node finite-element scheme that supports two-way coupling between cut-cell rods without expensive remeshing. We compare our approach with traditional simulation methods using linear and higher-order finite elements and demonstrate its advantages in several challenging settings, such as low-resolution meshes, anisotropic triangulation, and stiff materials. Finally, we showcase several applications of our framework in cloth simulation, mixed Origami and Kirigami, and biologically-inspired soft wing simulation.
