**Abstract:**\
We develop a computational pipeline to facilitate the biomimetic design of
winged seeds. Our approach leverages 3D scans of natural winged seeds to
construct a bio-inspired design space by interpolating them with geodesic
coordinates in the 3D diffeomorphism group. We formulate aerodynamic
design tasks with probabilistic performance objectives and adapt a gradient-
free optimizer to explore the design space and minimize the expectation of
performance objectives efficiently and effectively. Our pipeline discovers
novel winged seed designs that outperform natural counterparts in aerodynamic tasks, including long-distance dispersal and guided flight. We validate
the physical fidelity of our pipeline by showcasing paper models of selected
winged seeds in the design space and reporting their similar aerodynamic
behaviors in simulation and reality.
