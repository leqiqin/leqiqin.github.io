About Me
======
Greetings,

I am an Assistant Researcher at the Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute.
My research focus encompasses the intricate domains of computer graphics, physical simulation, and digital geometry.
I am deeply passionate about exploring the intersections of mathematics, computer science, physics, and art, seeking innovative solutions to complex challenges within these fields.

I earned my Master's degree in Computational Design from Carnegie Mellon University, where I cultivated a multidisciplinary approach to research.
Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Visual Communication Design with a minor in mathematics and applied mathematics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Looking ahead, I plan to apply for a Ph.D. position in fall 2024.
Eager to delve deeper into the realms of computer graphics and its profound implications, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of further academic exploration.
